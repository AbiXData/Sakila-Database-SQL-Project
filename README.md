# SQL Portfolio

This repository contains SQL exercises and queries I solved using the Sakila database.  
The projects demonstrate my skills in:

- JOIN operations
- Aggregate functions
- Subqueries
- Filtering and grouping
- Extracting business insights from data

Each project folder contains:

1. `queries.sql` – all the SQL queries with comments
2. `insights.md` – summary of insights drawn from the queries
3. `README.md` – explanation of the project, business questions, and objectives
